% The purpose of this function is to plot evolutionarily
% singular bird phenology with respect to optimal hatching
% time. When run without any parameters, it produces the
% left-most pane of Figure 1. Otherwise parameters can be
% specified to explore how Figure 1 changes with changes in
% a parameter value.
%
% Note that the components were all taken as f(y,z), where 
% z is the prelaying period. In the general model in the
% paper we use f(x,y). The choice can be made on 
% convenience, so long as one is consistent throughout a
% given analysis.
%
%
% INPUTS
%
% p: A dictionary of parameter values. Use the file params.m
% for an example of how to specify one of these.
%
% change_p: A string specifying the key of one of the
% parameter values defined in p.
%
% change_p_val: The value to which change_p should be set.
%
% x_c_hi: The upper value of the optimal hatching time range
% over which the figure should be generated.
%
% x_c_lo: The low value of the optimal hatching time range
% over which the figure should be generated.
%
% y0: The starting guess for what the evolutionarily
% singular arrival time is at x_c = x_c_hi.
% Note that if the solver is failing, it's probably because
% either this value or z0 have not been chosen close enough
% to the true values.
%
% z0: The starting guess for what the evolutionarily
% singular prelaying period is at x_c = x_c_hi. If x_c_hi is
% in the 'flat' region for y, it's a good idea to set this
% such that x is close to the optimal hatching time. 
% Note that if the solver is failing, it's probably because
% either this value or y0 have not been chosen close enough
% to the true values.
%
% print_flag: Determines if the return values will be
% written to a .dat file or not. Set this to 1 if you'd like
% that or any other value if not.
%
% plot_flag: Determines if the return values will be
% plotted within Octave or not. Set this to 1 if you'd like
% that or any other value if not.
%
%
% OUTPUTS
% 
% x_cV: A vector of x_c values in the range specified. 
%
% yzV: A matrix of [y*,z*] values in the range specified,
% corresponding to x_cV for easy plotting.
%
% nV: A vector of population sizes corresponding to x_cV.
