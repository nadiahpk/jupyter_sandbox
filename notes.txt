To start the jupyter notebook:

~/.local/bin/jupyter-notebook

---

Sliders weren't showing, so followed instructions here:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36351109/ipython-notebook-ipywidgets-does-not-show

did

pip3 install ipywidgets
~/.local/bin/jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension

---

nbviewer only does static, but look here: 

https://github.com/binder-examples/requirements

---

added the requirements.txt which was needed so mybinder could import numpy, matplotlib etc
go to mybinder.org and put in the main directory for my jupyter sandbox repository

---

To get the html for a widget, in the Notebook you click on Widgets and Embed Widgets and paste it into a html file.
See here http://minrk-ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/embedding.html
I need to presave the data and plots though ...
